# ef-coding-challenge
# Introduction:
We gather raw HTML pages from retail sites and then extract specific values which we then persist in an elastic-search datastore.

In the attached json output - a standard response to one of our api endpoints - is a representation of a view of supermarket-products in our database as a result of our gather process.  From this we create various views in our web based tool.  

Can you show us how you might create a front end from this data?

(3 of the fields - urls - are dummy data, and you donâ€™t need to try to use them)


# Problems/Challenges:
1.	Create a reactJS component as a tabular view to render the JSON provided.  Choose a few columns that make sense.
2.	Extend the single webpage, or create others, to use the data in other interesting ways, perhaps a use of a charting library.

Feel free to render as you like, but bear in mind we are more interesting in your constructions of reactJS components and how this is represented in real data on the screen.
Notes

* Just write the best code you can.
*	Spend only a couple of hours, not more.
*	Add the code to your own GitHub account and send the link to  jordan.dick@ef.uk.com
* Learn loads and have fun. Good luck!
